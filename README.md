# MixedRealityStarterKit
The Mixed Reality Starter Kit was created as a reusable template for quickly publishing apps that display interactive 3D holograms to Microsoft's HoloLens with little to no programming or scripting knowledge. The kit includes basic visual buttons, hand gestures, and voice commands for model rotation, resizing, hiding portions of a model, and undoing these actions.
